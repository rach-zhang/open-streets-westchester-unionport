Westchester-Unionport follows the patterns of restaurants located in the Bronx area for the most part. High rates of both sidewalk and roadway seating availability, and if the restaurant chose only one or the other, the rates of the sidewalk seating is much higher than the rate of the roadway seating. However, something unique in particular about this neighborhood that is not seen in other Bronx neighborhoods is the availability for open street dining. This availability creates a great environment for the restaurants, as it increases the space available for the customers and overall increases the enjoyment for the customers.
